    "Write a Python program that determines which stocks to buy to maximize profit, considering you can only spend up to your savings amount. You can buy multiple stocks, but you can only buy each stock once.\n",

    "#### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "savings = 500\n",
    "current_prices = [100, 200, 150, 300]\n",
    "future_prices = [150, 400, 120, 450]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Maximum profit: $250\n",
    "Stocks bought: [1, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- With $500 savings, we can buy stock at index 1 ($200) and index 3 ($300)\n",
    "- Stock 1: Buy at $200, sell at $400, profit = $200\n",
    "- Stock 3: Buy at $300, sell at $450, profit = $150\n",
    "- Total profit = $200 + $150 = $250\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Follow-up Questions\n",
    "1. How would you handle cases where all stocks are losing money?\n",
    "2. Can you optimize the solution if we're allowed to buy fractional shares?\n",
    "3. What if we can buy the same stock multiple times?"
