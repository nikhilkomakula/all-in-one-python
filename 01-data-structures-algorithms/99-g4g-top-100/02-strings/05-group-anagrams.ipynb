This is because for each word, we iterate through its characters to count the frequency of each character, which takes O(m) time. We then check if the key (tuple of character frequencies) is already in the table, which takes O(1) time on average. Overall, the time complexity is O(n * m).\n",

In the worst case scenario, each word is unique and we need to store the character frequencies for each word separately, resulting in O(n * m) space complexity."
