    "Hinge loss, also known as max-margin loss, is a loss function that is particularly useful for training models in binary classification problems. It is designed to maximize the margin between classes, making it especially effective for support vector machines. The key idea behind hinge loss is to penalize the model more when it misclassifies a sample that is closer to the decision boundary."
