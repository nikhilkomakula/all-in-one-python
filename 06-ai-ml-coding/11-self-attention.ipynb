    "Self-attention is a key mechanism in transformer models that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when encoding a particular word. Here's a breakdown of how self-attention is computed in transformers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. **Input Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each input word (or token) is first converted into a <ins>vector representation</ins>, typically using embeddings. For a sequence of words, this results in a matrix $X$ of shape $(n, d)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens and $d$ is the dimensionality of the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Linear Transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The input matrix $X$ is transformed into three different matrices: **Queries (Q)**, **Keys (K)**, and **Values (V)**. This is done using <ins>learned weight matrices</ins>:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queries**: $Q = XW_Q$\n",
    "- **Keys**: $K = XW_K$\n",
    "- **Values**: $V = XW_V$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_Q$, $W_K$, and $W_V$ are weight matrices of shape $(d, d_k)$, $(d, d_k)$, and $(d, d_v)$ respectively, where $d_k$ and $d_v$ are the dimensions of the keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. **Compute Attention Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention scores are computed by taking the <ins>dot product of the queries with the keys</ins>:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention Scores} = QK^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a matrix of shape $(n, n)$, where each element $(i, j)$ represents the attention score of the $i$\\-th token with respect to the $j$\\-th token.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. **Scale the Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>To prevent the dot products from growing too large</ins> (which can lead to gradients that are too small), the scores are <ins>scaled</ins> by the <ins>square root of the dimension of the keys</ins>:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Scaled Scores} = \\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. **Apply Softmax**\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaled scores are then passed through a <ins>softmax</ins> function to obtain the <ins>attention weights</ins>. This converts the scores into a probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention Weights} = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. **Compute the Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the output of the self-attention layer is computed by <ins>multiplying the attention weights with the values</ins>:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output} = \\text{Attention Weights} \\cdot V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a new matrix of shape $(n, d_v)$, which is the weighted sum of the values based on the attention scores."

    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
